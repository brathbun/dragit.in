    		<h2>About the Information we collect</h2>
    		Our servers log information about each computer connecting with our site such as IP address, device characteristics, operating system, browser type, type of connection, page and image viewing statistics, and incoming and outgoing links.  We also log the metadata associated with any images or videos you upload. None of this automatically collected technical information is associated with any identified person at the time it is collected, but it could be associated with you if we are required to disclose our server logs as a result of a subpoena or other legal process, some third party such as your internet provider could match our anonymous technical information with you, using information beyond what is found on our servers.<br /><br />

			We may use cookies, web beacons, or other anonymous tracking information to improve our server’s interaction with your computer, and we may partner with third party advertisers who may (themselves or through their partners) place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. These cookies enable more customized ads, content or services to be provided to you. No personally identifiable information is on, or is connected to, these cookies. To opt-out of these cookies, please go to http://www.privacychoice.org/choose.<br /><br />

			We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, <a href="http://networkadvertising.org/">click here</a>.<br /><br />

			We currently do not collect such information as name, address, email address, profile information, and credit card billing information. We consider such personal data to be “Private Data,” and if we were to start collecting that data it would be noted in this privacy policy and subject to the “Personal Data Protection” paragraph below, with the following exception: Any data (text, images, videos, etc.) you post to a public forum on our site, linked to or from our site, or share via a social networking function, will not be considered “Private Data” and will not be subject to the “Personal Data Protection” paragraph below.<br /><br />

			<h2>Personal Data Protection</h2>
			Dragit.in does not disclose to any third party Private Data you have given us, except to the extent necessary for credit card processing; in such cases your Private Data is used by credit card processors only for that purpose (including guarding against credit card fraud). The only exception, obviously, is if we are forced to disclose the information as a result of a subpoena or other legal process. You may correct, amend, or delete inaccurate Private Data information you have given us, although any credit card transactions that have already taken place will be unaffected. For legal reasons we may retain backup and/or archival copies of information prior to your corrections, amendments, or deletions. We take every reasonable precaution to protect your Private Data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. You are responsible for taking every reasonable precaution on your end to protect any unauthorized person from accessing your Dragit.in account.<br /><br />

			We may revise our privacy policy from time to time without notice.<br /><br />
